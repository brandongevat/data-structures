## Singular - singly.c
* Operations
	- insertFront - O(1)
	- insertEnd - O(n)
	- insertInorder - O(n)
	- delete - O(n)

## Circular - ciruclar.c
* Advantages over singular:
	- Able to traverse to previous node
	- Can be traversed from any node

* Disadvantages over singular:
	- More memory
 
* Operations:
	- insertFront - O(1)
	- insertEnd - O(n)
	- insertInorder - O(n)
	- delete - O(n)

## Doubly - doubly.c
* Advantages over singular:
	- Traversal can be forwards or backwards
	- Even easier than circular to go to previous node

* Disadvantages over singular:
	- More memory
	- Harder to implement, along with ins./del. functions

* Operations:
	- insertFront - O(1)
	- insertEnd - O(1)
	- insertInorder - O(n)
	- delete - O(n)

## Doubly circular - doubly-circular.c
